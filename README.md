# Hekate Toolbox

A toolbox that allows the user to change settings of the loader (requires a modified version of loader). It was originally developed for the use with tomGER's SDFiles (Later AtlasNX's Kosmos), but fully works with Hekate-based CFW configurations.

## Current Features
- Reading and modifying of the hbmenu launch button combination 
- Actually modifying the hbmenu config as well so settings stick across reboots
- Reading and modifying whether the album or the hbmenu launches by default
- Sysmodule hotloading and unloading
- Reboot to Hekate profiles and the Hekate menu
- HID-mitm button config
